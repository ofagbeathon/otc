# Ofagbe Technical College

Ofagbe Technical College, popularly known as OTC/ Ofatech, is among the few technical colleges in Delta State. 
As you may know or may not have known, Ofatech was built and managed by the good people of Ofagbe before the State Government showed up.

The goal of this project is to develop a website to consolidate on the effort of the State Government and the role played by Ofagbe people as well as to give quality information to the general public about the college.
